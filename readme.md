# Game Dev Markdown Templates

This folder contains markdown template for a Game Design Document. The template is broken up into a tree structure with one Markdown file per section similar to a website. This file structure helps clean up the file system, prevents slow Markdown renderers from glitching, and helps you focus on writhing one section at a time. In order to edit these files we recommend you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). [Atom](https://atom.io/) is okay but the Markdown renderer is notoriously bad as of the writing of this.

## Organization

  The directions for how to use the templates are stored in the [Astartup Cookbook](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/astartup.cookbook/tree/master/getting_started/markdown). There are different Markdown templates for different tasks:

* [Markdown Software Engineering](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/markdown.software_engineering)
* Markdown Game Design
* [Markdown Cookbook](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/markdown.cookbook)

### Document Templates

* [Game Design Document Markdown Template](./gdd/readme.md)

## Quickstart Guide

```

**2.** Read the directions for how to use the Markdown templates in the [Astartup Cookbook](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/astartup.cookbook/tree/master/getting_started/markdown).

## MVP RoadMap

***When you're first starting out your project, your roadmap should be here in the root `readme.md` file because people have very low tolerance for non-working code, they will just move on in search of the easy thing and you can't blame them, so if you're trying to woo contributors, you must do it with your Mission and vision, then immediately after show the action plan that someone else things is a good idea achievable, and worth their time to contribute too.***

We can achieve a Minimum Viable Product by completing the following project phases:

1. Foo - In this phase we will say hello world.
1. Bar - In this phase we will say Foo and Bar.

This is a good idea because foo and bar are both common names for abstract functions.

## Contributions

If you have any essential game document templates, please fee free to submit them via an Issue ticket. Thanks.

## Mission and Vision

The mission of Markdown Game Development is to help you start out or get your project onto the right foot and increase productivity with Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) documentation. Our vision is to automate as much documentation as possible with [KabukiPress](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/kabukipress).
