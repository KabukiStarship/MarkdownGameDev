# Game Dev Markdown Templates

This folder contains markdown template for a Game Design Document. The template is broken up into a tree structure with one Markdown file per section similar to a website. This file structure helps clean up the file system, prevents slow Markdown renderers from glitching, and helps you focus on writhing one section at a time. In order to edit these files we recommend you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). [Atom](https://atom.io/) is okay but the Markdown renderer is notoriously bad as of the writing of this.
